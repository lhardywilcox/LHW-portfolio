### LHW-portfolio

## Description
The goal of this project was to develop a portfolio to showcase online examples of my work as a designer/developer.

I built all the HTML and css for this project.  I created a Github repository, built the basic HTML and css code, then uploaded to the repository.  From there, I created issues to help me address the items I had not yet addressed from the acceptance criteria.  I successfully created and merged branches as I completed work on the issues.

As I don't currently have projects to add to the portfolio, I used placeholders for the project tiles, and the links don't go anywhere.  These will be updated as I develop projects through this bootcamp.

I learned SO MUCH about organizing my code, positioning items, and ways to make my work more responsive.  I also learned how much I still have to learn to really make my work shine.

## User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good condidate for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
